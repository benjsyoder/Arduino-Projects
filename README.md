Here is the code used to run the page-detection arduino project for sensing when an order has printed.

Button push will mute any alarm for 5 minutes.

Pushing the button again will cancel the timer

Distance sensor will prevent alarms while working at the printer

Switch will place the sensor in "active" or "paused" mode

Waits 20 seconds after page is detected to start alarms
